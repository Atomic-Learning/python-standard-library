<p>The Python Standard library is a collection of code that comes bundled with Python, providing a wide range of functionality that is useful in a wide range of use cases. If some functionality you want use exists in the Standard Library, it is almost always preferable to use it, rather than write your own code as it will save you time and effort, and the code will have been tested and optimised by many users.</p>
    
<p>The full list of these packages are given in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Python documentation</a>.</p>

<h2>Importing from the Standard Library</h2>

<p>To use a module from the Standard Library, you need to import it using the <code>import</code> statement. For example, to use the <code>math</code> module, which provides mathematical functions and constants, you would write:</p>

<py-cell>import math</py-cell>

<p>You can then use the functions and constants provided by the <code>math</code> module, such as <code>math.pi</code>, which is a variable which gives the value of $\pi$</p>

<py-cell>print(math.pi)</py-cell>

In order for the above cell to work, you need to run the first cell containing the import statement first. If you try to run the second cell without running the first cell, you will get an error saying that <code>math</code> is not defined. This is because we need to import from the Standard Library before we can use it. Try reloading the page and running the second cell first to see this error for yourself.
