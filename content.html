<p>The Python Standard library is a collection of code that comes bundled with Python, providing a wide range of functionality that is useful in a wide range of use cases. If some functionality you want use exists in the Standard Library, it is almost always preferable to use it, rather than write your own code as it will save you time and effort, and the code will have been tested and optimised by many users.</p>
    
<p>The full list of these packages are given in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Python documentation</a>.</p>

<h2>Importing from the Standard Library</h2>

<p>To use a module from the Standard Library, you simply need to import it using the <code>import</code> statement. For example, to use the <code>math</code> module, which provides mathematical functions and constants, you would write:</p>

<py-cell>import math</py-cell>

<p>You can then use the functions and constants provided by the <code>math</code> module, such as <code>math.pi</code>, which is a variable which gives the value of $\pi$</p>

<py-cell>print(math.pi)</py-cell>

\pi \approx 3.141592653589793
